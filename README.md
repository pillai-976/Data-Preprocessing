# Pre-processing-of-Housing Market dataset

The dataset is available for download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market?select=Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv). Among the 21 features(both categorical and numerical) in the dataset some are Address, Type of Real Estate, Suburb, Method of selling, Rooms, Price, Real Estate Agent, Date of sale, and Distance from C.B.D. The dataset contains a large number of NULL values that must be dealt with before any analysis can be performed. The first step in data analysis is to clean the data. The missing/NULL values in the dataset are handled using the pandas library's functions.

## Common techniques to deal with missing/NULL values are:
### 1. Drop the feature
### 2. Drop the row
### 3. Impute the missing value
### 4. Replace it
